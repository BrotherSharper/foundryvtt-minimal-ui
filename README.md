## Minimal UI for FoundryVTT

Configurable UI module, allows the user to hide, collapse or auto-hide components separately.

This includes hiding Foundry's Logo, Players List, Scene Navigation and Macro Bar.

## Support with Systems and Modules
MinimalUI is made as agnostic as possible. Yet, it is impossible to ensure maximum compatibility.
I invite you to share any systems or modules that conflict with MinimalUI or do not look correctly.
Also do share systems and modules Minimal UI already works with too!

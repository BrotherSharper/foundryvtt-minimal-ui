## Foundry VTT Module

Minimalistic UI aggressivelly hides or shrinks non-essential UI hud elements from the screen.

This module may not be suitable for everyone, but I find myself not needing all of the default elements in my games.
And I appreciate the space :)

* Hidden Foundry Logo
* Hidden Macro Bar (If you use macro bar, then this mod is not for you)
* Hidden Scene Navigation panel (Notice you can no longer allow player navigation)
* Shrinked player list and fonts
* Shrinked icon size and position of the left-side tools, and moved up

Any feedback welcome

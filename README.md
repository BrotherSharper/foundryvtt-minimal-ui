## Minimal UI for FoundryVTT

Configurable UI module, allows the user to hide, collapse or auto-hide components separately.

This includes hiding Foundry's Logo, Players List, Scene Navigation and Macro Bar.

* Foundry Logo may be hidden or resized, and made clickable to toggle UI elements.
* Scenes, Player list and left side controls customized for minimalism by default
* Scene Navigation allows preview the map on mouse over (GM Only)
* Macro Bar may be hidden, collapsed, auto-hidden (default) or shown
* Macro Bar may be repositioned along the X-Axis
* Players list may be hidden completely, shown on hover or shown normally
* Allows Hiding or having the scene navigation collapsed by default
* Left controls may be collapsed into a single column (or not)
* Left controls may be standard or small size
* Left controls may be moved vertically and set behavior to auto-hidden
* Colors of borders and shadows and their strength customizeable

## Support with Systems and Modules
MinimalUI is made as agnostic as possible. Yet, it is impossible to ensure maximum compatibility.
I invite you to share any systems or modules that conflict with MinimalUI or do not look correctly.
Also do share systems and modules Minimal UI already works with too!

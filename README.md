## Foundry VTT Module

Minimalistic UI aggressivelly hides or shrinks non-essential UI hud elements from the screen.

This module may not be suitable for everyone, but I find myselef not needing the Macro Bar, the Scene Navigation and by the amount of space UI elements consume.
For me, I prioritize the actual Scene and saving space as much as possible for a smooth experience.

Any feedback welcome
